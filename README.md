Install both the resource pack and the datapack for everything to work smoothly!

Create an End Relay in the Crafting Table, 4 Obsidian in the corners, 4 Popped Chorus Fruit on the edges, and a Lodestone in the center.
Place the End Relay in the End. Right click it with a Lodestone Compass to set the destination.
Right click with an End Crystal to charge it, the right click it again to teleport!
