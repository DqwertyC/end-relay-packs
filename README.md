# End Relay Packs
Data and Resource Pack for Kenadian's "End Relay" idea, originally posted here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1i4izl25V4

Install both the resource pack and the datapack for everything to work smoothly!

Create an End Relay in the Smithing Table, using a Spire smithing template, a Lodestone, and a Block of Netherite.
Place the End Relay in the End. Right click it with a Lodestone Compass to set the destination.
Right click with an End Crystal to charge it, the right click it again to teleport!
